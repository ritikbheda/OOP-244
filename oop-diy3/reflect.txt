1. an empty state is done to initialize the data members. it si done so that while declaring,
if the data members got any random values, and futher using them could prove to be dangorous.
so that,  the data members are brought to an empty state where possible (most common in most 
cases) could be like  0, '', '\0', etc.

2. all the data members and functions in a class are initially under the private sector if not
specified while in the case of the struct, all the data member and functions are publicly 
defined(if not specied).

3. many data members and function should not be allowed to be accessed by unknown or foreign
clients which many leak the privacy/security of the data of the class object. so, class privacy 
helps in accomplishing that target by not allowing foreign clients to access the data. 

4. I learned many new lesson and techniques in this workshop, some of them are:
- how to use 'this' keyword. 'this' keyword helps to access the data of the object passed,
which may be of much use in the future programs.
- i also used and learned about the setprecision() in this workshop.
- i also had a good lesson on the encapsulation of the classes.
- constructor, destructor for a class are added in the list. 
- adding, dividing a large task in smaller units and then to solve it is also a major skill 
i learned in this workshop which is a much need for a programmer. 
- At last, this workshop gave me a practice on many good topics of the language like pointers,
dynamic memory allocation, classes and many such which will be of great use for my future 
projects.
